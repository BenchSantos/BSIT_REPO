•	Uses and Functions
The main function and use of Industry 4.0 is to build smart factories that automate and optimize industrial processes using digital technologies. This is the use of sensors to gather data from machines and equipment, the real-time analysis of the data to spot problems or inefficiencies, and the use of automation and robotics to carry out operations more quickly and accurately. Further benefits of Industry 4.0 includes increased production flexibility due to the systems' quick response to changes in demand or supply chain disruptions. For example:
•	The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms allow machines and gadgets to communicate with one another in smart factories, which are fully automated and networked manufacturing facilities. This enables real-time data analysis and manufacturing process optimization, increasing productivity and efficiency (Kagermann et al., 2013).
•	Predictive maintenance monitors machinery and equipment in real-time and foresees when maintenance is necessary using data analytics and AI algorithms. By enabling preventive maintenance, this lowers the expenses and downtime caused by unforeseen problems (Jardim-Goncalves et al., 2017).
•	With additive manufacturing, also referred to as 3D printing, digital designs are used to add layers of material to produce physical objects. This technology makes it possible to precisely manufacture complicated parts and components, which eliminates the need for conventional production techniques and cuts down on lead times (Dudek & Kunc, 2020).
•	Cobots, also known as collaborative robots, are intended to work alongside human workers to complete activities that are either too dangerous or repetitious for people to handle. Cobots are a useful tool in many industries because they can be trained to learn from human employees and adapt to new activities (Garcia-Sabater et al., 2019).
•	Industry 4.0 technology can be applied to enhance each process of the supply chain, from acquiring raw materials to delivering finished goods. This entails analyzing shipments in real-time, keeping an eye on inventory levels, and using predictive analytics to foresee demand and adapt production accordingly (Lee & Kao, 2018).

•	Importance and Benefit
Industry 4.0's significance stems from its ability to revolutionize the manufacturing sector and spur economic growth. Companies can enhance product quality, increase production, and save costs by integrating digital technology and smart factories. In addition, new employment opportunities in fields like robots, cybersecurity, and data analysis may result from Industry 4.0.

Increased efficiency and production, enhanced safety, and minimal environmental effect are all advantages of Industry 4.0. Companies may lessen their environmental impact and conserve resources by employing data analytics to streamline procedures and cut waste. Additionally, by lowering the risk of injury from manual labor, the use of automation and robotics can increase workplace safety. Additional examples:
•	The ability to gather and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time is one of Industry 4.0's primary advantages. In order to optimize production procedures and raise product quality, producers might use this information to spot patterns and trends. Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring, for instance, can be used to identify equipment problems before they arise, minimizing downtime and maintenance expenses (Wang et al., 2016).
•	Collaborative robots (cobots) being incorporated into production processes is another advantage of Industry 4.0. Cobots are made to operate alongside people, boosting productivity and lowering the possibility of accidents at work. They can be utilized for a variety of jobs, including packaging, testing, and assembly (Graetz et al., 2015).
•	Industry 4.0 also includes the use of additive manufacturing, usually referred to as 3D printing. Utilizing less expensive tooling and equipment, this technology enables manufacturers to produce intricate parts and components quickly and effectively. Additionally, it permits more flexibility and customization in product design (Kong et al., 2017).
